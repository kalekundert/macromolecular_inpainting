Compare equivariance
********************

I've consistently seen that equivariant models significantly outperform 
non-equivariant ones, but I haven't yet made this comparison between two models 
that are truly identical in every way except for equivariance.  MY goal for 
this experiment is to make such a comparison.

Results
=======

- Neither model has really finished training after 100 epochs, but the result 
  is still clear.
