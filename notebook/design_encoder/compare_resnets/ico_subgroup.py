# I think that the quotient space `Ico / C(5)` might work the same as `SÂ² = 
# SO(3) / SO(2)`, for the purpose of doing an IFT after the MLP.  If I can 
# really convince myself of this, then I can experiment with icosahedral 
# networks.
#
# The other way to do these experiments is to wait until I get the Atom3d 
# datasets going.  Those mostly have invariant outputs, which will be easy to 
# get regardless of what group I use.
