Compare DenseNets
*****************

Another successful image processing architecture is the DenseNet, which is like 
a ResNet that uses concatenation instead of addition to make it easier for 
information to move between layers.

  After performing a few initial experiments with DenseNets, including 
  :expt:`25`, I ended up mostly focusing on ResNets.  My perception was that 
  ResNets were easier to train.  Now that I have more experience, though, I 
  want to come back and see if I can get DenseNets to outperform ResNets.
