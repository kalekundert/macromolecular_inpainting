Inpaint macromolecular images
*****************************

In this experiment, I will use the best diffusion models from :expt:`82` to 
fill in masked regions of macromolecular images.  In theory, these images will 
encode sequences that could reasonably exist in nature, subject to the 
constraints in the unmasked regions.
