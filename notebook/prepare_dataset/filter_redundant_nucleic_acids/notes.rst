******************************
Filter redundant nucleic acids
******************************

Similar to :expt:`37`, I want to remove redundant nucleic acid structures from 
my dataset.  However, there is no equivalent of Foldseek for nucleic acids, so 
I either have to just do sequence alignments, or there have to be few enough 
structures that I can do structural alignments.
