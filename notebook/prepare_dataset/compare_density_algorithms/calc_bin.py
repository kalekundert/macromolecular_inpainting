    Divide space into bins of the given size, and calculate the density (in 
    units of atoms/nmÂ³) in each one.

    This is much faster, but slightly less accurate, than calculating densities 
    at individual points of interest.  The reason is that every atom is 
    considered exactly once.  To estimate densities at points that aren't on 
    the grid, fast linear interpolation can be used.
